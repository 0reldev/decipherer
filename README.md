# Quest "Java 05: Methods"

## Educational exercise from Wild Code School

The repository contains a simple exercise to learn how to use methods in Java.

The <code>Main</code> class contains three secret messages:

The purpose is to create methods to decode those messages following some rules: 
1. Calculate the length of the chain and divide it by 2 to get the "key figure"
2. Retrieve a sub-string from the secret message. The computed "key figure" gives the length of this sub-string. The starting character is the 6th.
3. Replace the <code>@#?</code> characters with a space.
4. Reverse the string. 

In the end, once that the algorithm works, the three secret messages are displayed in the command lines:
